## What is Client & Server
**A client** is computer hardware device or software that accesses a service made available by a server.The server is more often (but not always) located on a seperate physical computer.

**A server** is physical computer dedicated to services to serve the need of other computers.Depending on the service that is running, it could be a file server, database server, home media server, print server or web server.


### 1 tier
we have single system, where client & server in same machine is comes under 1 tier architecture.

### 2 Tier
We have multiple client, but they are accessing single database server which is located on different server.

### 3 tier
Presenation layer

Application layer

Data Layer

### Application Programing Interface (API)

[ Front End of the application]

[Middle Layer (API Layer)]
- This is responsiblity of mid layer to take the data from frontend and insert into the backend
- This is responsiblity of mid layer to fetch the data from backend and dispay on the fronend

[Backend Layer]

*** API is way to communication between two layer.
